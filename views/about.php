				<h1>About Impossible Octopus Fitness</h1>
				<h2> Not really, this page is about RETTIWT!</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>	
					Thank you for visiting our site about "Impossible Octopus Fitness." We are currently in beta and conducting an experiment with SEO. 
					As you may have guessed, this website is not about "impossible octopus fitness". If you can find a good quality site about "impossible octopus fitness," you should send the webmaster of this site an email.
				</p>
				<p>
					The point of this site is to create a Twitter clone that we are calling RETTIWT. This project was created by Rick Houser and Chandler Mayo for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">Holberton School</a>. So what's really up with having 'impossible octopus fitness' on this page? We are trying to secure a ranking for the term, call it an experiment. Sorry if you were looking for a site about octopi workouts or something about octopoda physical health...

				<h1>Octo Exercise</h1>
				<h2> Do the octo flail~</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Since you are already on this site, I figured we might as well amuse you with humorous images. =) 
				</p>
				<p>
					This is how Octopi exercise. There is plenty of scientific proof showing that working out as an octopus does will help lose weight. The best part of this type of workout is the flailing of the tentacles! Keep those 8 arms strong so you don't end up as a plate of Calamari or Takoyaki!

				<h1>Octo Dance</h1>
				<h2>Devilfish Fitness!</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The Octopoda dance goes back to the early 1970s when Deep Sea, eight legged dances were all the rage. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As illustrated above, this octopus dance is not for squid or other aquatic dancing creatures. Grab your favorite Takoyaki snack and get ready for some impossible octopus fitness!
