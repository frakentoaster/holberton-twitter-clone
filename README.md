# Rettiwt - Holberton School Twitter Clone Project

The purpose of this project is to pair program while building a bare bones (html/css/js only) twitter clone. Each student is paired with a buddy and they work together to create a Twitter clone. We are given specific restraints and must implement certain things, like gradient buttons. While not completely aesthetically pleasing, this project really helped us learn new things and gain experience in front-end work and SEO.

### The SEO Challenge

After creating the project, all students were given an SEO challenge.
given the words "Impossible Octopus Fitness", we were tasked with obtaining the highest google search ranking for that given term. After 3 months of SEO tricks, the school completed the challenge and announced us the winners. It was definitely a lot of fun working on teams and learning SEO tactics.
